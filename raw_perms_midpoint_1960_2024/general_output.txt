 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (B  7).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by poor forecasts and/or backcasts.
            Users should check the fit of any existing regARIMA model,
            using the diagnostics in the check spec.

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (D 12).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by substantial outliers in the original
            series.  Users should fit a regARIMA model to the series
            using outlier regression variables to correct for such effects.

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend

          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by poor forecasts and/or backcasts.
            Users should check the fit of any existing regARIMA model,

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (D  7).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by poor forecasts and/or backcasts.
            Users should check the fit of any existing regARIMA model,
            using the diagnostics in the check spec.

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (D 12).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by substantial outliers in the original
            series.  Users should fit a regARIMA model to the series
            using outlier regression variables to correct for such effects.

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (B  7).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by poor forecasts and/or backcasts.
            Users should check the fit of any existing regARIMA model,
            using the diagnostics in the check spec.

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (D  7).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by poor forecasts and/or backcasts.
            Users should check the fit of any existing regARIMA model,
            using the diagnostics in the check spec.

 WARNING: At least one negative value was found in one of the trend
          cycle estimates (D 12).  Negative value(s) will be replaced
          either by the mean of its two closest neighbors that are greater
          than zero, or by the nearest value that  is greater than zero
          (if the value is on either end of the series).
   
            These are often caused by substantial outliers in the original
            series.  Users should fit a regARIMA model to the series
            using outlier regression variables to correct for such effects.
   
  WARNING: Series should not be a candidate for seasonal adjustment
            because the spectrum of the original series (Table A1 or B1)
            has no visually significant seasonal peaks.
